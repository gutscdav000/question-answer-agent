D.A. First Draft  April 20, 2000
D.A. Blue Revised - May 5 2000
 EXTERIOR. DOWNTOWN L.A. - 110 FREEWAY  NIGHT

It slices through a canyon of tall buildings. Hardly any
traffic at this time, just heavy haulers. A gasoline
tanker, a car carrier, a flatbed with a huge bulldozer.
ANGLE ON

A BIG RIG. The Peterbuilt tractor pulls a nondescript white
container with Japanese export seals on its padlocks.

INTERIOR. BIG RIG (MOVING) - NIGHT

HUMMING to country music, a TRUCKER rubs weary eyes and
checks the clock: 4:00AM. He reaches for a thermos.

RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE BLARES somewhere behind him.
Startled, his coffee spills. He peers into his mirror.

BLINDING HEADLIGHTS

He squints, lifts an arm for shade. He HEARS a performance
engine ROAR, its turbo SQUEALING. Looks out the window.

TRUCKER'S POINT OF VIEW

He glimpses his own reflection in the glistening hood of a
black on black Honda Civic built for speed. It takes off up
the freeway and is gone, just like that.

IN THE MIRROR

More HEADLIGHTS. Blinding.

VROOM! VROOM! VROOM! Three more tricked Civics appear
like rockets, CRISS-CROSSING in front of the truck.

The little black cars cavort playfully around the semis as
they zoom up the freeway. Fading in the distance.

THE TRUCKER
Sucks air through his teeth; unamused by the deadly antics.

TRUCKER
Stupid damn kids.

EXTERIOR. 110 FREEWAY - NIGHT 
Our Big Rig passes an on-ramp. From which...
THE FOUR CIVICS

Suddenly appear. Their engines, music SCREAMING. They box
in the Big Rig as it enters a long tunnel. 1

i

INTERIOR. BIG RIG (MOVING) - NIGHT

The Trucker watches in disbelief as the sunroof of the lead
car opens and a BANDIT emerges wearing an odd helmet and
mask. He raises a speargun.

With a finger, the Trucker stabs the EMERGENCY button on his
CB radio.

TRUCKER
I'm being jacked! I-5 North at the
110 interchange!
STATIC. There is no signal in the tunnel.
INTERIOR. TUNNEL  NIGHT
The Bandit shoulders the speargun. Aims at the Big Rig.

THWACK-DINK! A spear pierces windshield. Barbs extend,
anchoring it.

The Bandit clips the spear's cable to the rollcage. The
Driver punches the gas. The cable pulls taught and the
windshield is yanked from its frame. It SHATTERS against
the highway.

The Bandit unclips the cable from the rollcage. He loads
another spear into the gun.

THWACK-DUNK! The spear slams into the seat next to the
Driver. This time the cable clipped to the arrow leads
to...

The Bandit, climbing out the sunroof, revealing a cable reel
on his chest. He rides the Civic like an insane surfer.

He pulls the pin of a chemical grenade in his hand. It
smokes furiously.

The Bandit leaps into space... hits a button -- the winch on
his chest RATCHETS him to the Big Rig.

The Bandit bounces against the grill.

INTERIOR. BIG RIG (MOVING) - NIGHT 

Trucker watches the Bandit hurl the HISSING canister through
the missing windshield. White smoke fills the cab. The

Trucker slumps.

The Big Rig SWERVES WILDLY. The trailer whips right...
left... .

(CONTINUED)
CONTINUED: :

Nearly jackknifes. The Bandit climbs across the hood, into
the cab. About to smash into the...

TUNNEL WALL

He maneuvers into the driver's seat. He works the wheel and
gears with skill. The Big Rig pulls away from the wall,
straightens out, accelerates. It exits the tunnel and cuts

a hard right toward an offramp.

The Bandit gives the high sign. The little black cars fall
in behind like ducklings.

EXTERIOR. OFFRAMP  NIGHT

The Big Rig moving too fast, outside tires SCREAMING, it
threatens to tip, SCRAPING the steel safety rail.

EXTERIOR. SAN FERNANDO ROAD - NIGHT

A lone LAPD cruiser SCREECHES to a stop at the bottom of the
ramp. Two COPS get out, aim their 9's up the ramp.

The Big Rig's engine HOWLS. Its AIRHORN blowsin warning.
The Two Cops trade looks, dive out of the way as...

Whim The cruiser is smashed backwards into a bus stop
shelter with a collision repair advertisement.

The Rig barely manages the turn. Followed by the four
Civics. oo

A Cop SCREAMS into his radio. SEES the Civics have no
plates.

TWO POLICE CRUISERS slide sideways onto the empty road,
heavy duty V8's GROWLING.

The Civics simultaneously scatter down four different
sidestrokes,

The two cruisers focus on the Big Rig, a good distance
ahead.

INTERIOR. BIG RIG (MOVING) - NIGHT -

It pulls off San Fernando, down a side street, heading for a
the old warehouses along the L.A. River.

The Big Rig SMASHES through a metal gate..

Headlights hit a warehouse's wall -- finding large wooden
doors as the Big Rig swerves. CRASHES through the doors.

The Big Rig careens down an embankment. A HELICOPTER

arrives and hits it with the Nightsun. The Big Rig rolls

down the cement channel, precarious, out of control.

INTERIOR. POLICE CAR - COP POINT OF VIEW - NIGHT

The shattered doors are now an ugly pile of wood. The cop

car swerves, follows the side of the warehouse. Passes

though flattened fence. Now cruising the service road.

EXTERIOR. SERVICE ROAD - NIGHT 13B
It runs parallel to the river.
THE TWO COP CARS

Zoom up the road, following the Big Rig in the riverbed

below. To their amazement, it heads right for a forest of
concrete columns supporting a large bridge.

A COP approaches the smashed cab, gun drawn. He pulls at

gas pedal.

ANOTHER COP

Shines his light inside the open doors of the shipping
container -- It's empty.

INTERIOR. TOYOTA SUPRA - DAWN 16

A high-tech beast, its engine GRUMBLES angrily. At the
wheel is BRIAN, early 20's, good looking, athletic, a golden
boy. He plays his intense eyes over a bank of gauges and
readouts. Pure confidence as he flips switches.

He presses buttons on the turbo control. The readout BEEPS,
counts down from 10. He opens a door atop the gearshift,
exposing a red button. Brian leans forward, expectant.

BRIAN
Ten second quarter mile...

Orange cones ahead mark the finish.

An empty concrete sea. The bright green Supra with Arizona
plates is poised to pounce, a massive intercooler replacing
the front bumper.

The rear tires spin, smoke. The Supra shimmies a beat,

VROOM! The car rockets forward. Brian shifts, 2nd gear,
struggling for control, fishtailing. 3rd gear. The car
hits 90MPH. Then, the front end begins to float then...

Brian misfits. Gears GRIND. The car spins out,
corkscrewing across the parking lot. The world outside

performance parts; turbos, exhausts, rims. Gleaming gages
and winking dash computers.

HARRY, the proprietor, a tough older black guy, sits ona
stool filling out shipping labels. The cuff of his Dickies
has ridden above boot top to reveal a prosthetic leg. He
looks up at Brian, gives him an angry stare.

HARRY
What now

Brian rubs two fingers together -- Money. Harry crosses his
arms.

HARRY (CONTINUED)
I don't like you very much.

BRIAN
Don't have to like me. You just have
to listen to me.

Harry grudgingly hits the NO SALE key and gives Brian a
twenty from the register.

BRIAN (CONTINUED)

A beat as Brian checks her out.

Mia looks at Brian. She knows what he's going to say next.

BRIAN (CONTINUED)
How's a guy get a shot racing Dominic

Mia looks at him, disappointed he's like all the rest. She
slaps the change in his hand. Mia begins making the order.

Brian looks at the coffee in Mia's mug. It ripples with
vibration. Something is approaching. RUMBLING.

Four cars streak past the windows. Their turbos WHINE,
waste gates HISS.

Brian turns in time to see their dust. The NOISE fades.

stop behind Harry's pick-up.
21A INTERIOR. VINCE'S CIVIC - DAY 21A
The driver, VINCE, is a tough costumer in a wife beater, his
shaved head peppered with fight scars. Tatted and ripped,
Vince is an intimidator. His sidekick, JESSE, lanky and
baby-faced, a wry instigator, types on a laptop plugged into
the car's CPU.

An iridescent blue Celica GT and a magenta Eclipse, with
subtle yet trippy flower graphics, park across the street.

From the Celica emerges LEON, tall, half black, cocky.

thrills from racing. They lean against their cars and trade
knowing looks. ;

LETTY

Mia. Who though unhappy for Brian, knows Dominic always
triumphs. Brian thinks different. Fixes Dominic with a
look, intense and hopeful.

BRIAN
Me and you, quarter mile. How about

Dominic laughs. Vince, Jesse, Leon, Letty grin at Brian's
expense; just another small town kid with big city dreams.

DOMINIC
Don't talk to me again.

Brian frowns. Dominic crosses to the shop, herding Mia
inside. Brian looks down, SEES the sandwiches have been
crushed in the melee.

BRIAN
You owe me some food.

DOMINIC
Hook him up, Mia.

Dominic locks eyes with Brian. The intensity of his stare

take out food containers everywhere. A bank of monitors
shows Caltrans traffic camera views throughout L.A. Brian
enters with the same confidence he brought to the sandwich
shop. The WATCH OFFICER, a heavy desk jockey in Dockers,
eyes a frozen burrito in the microwave. He gives Brian a
warm smile.

WATCH OFFICER
You nail these pieces of shit. We're
counting on you.

faces we will see again.

And there's a mugshot of DOMINIC, photos of VINCE, JESSE,
LETTY and LEON, and even Mia, her photo obviously taken from
quite a distance. There are charts and graphs, teacher
comments from preschool, this is scientific crimefighting at
its best. Tanner and MUSE, a young plainclothes, sit before

Gentlemen, we're big time. I must
have had fifty calls today. A lot of
very important people have their eyes
on us. Hate to ride your back,
Officer O'Conner, but you're our best
shot. Let's get the brief.

Brian stands, crosses to the wall of photos. He angrily
stares at the picture of Dominic. Jams his finger in
Dominic's face.. :

BRIAN
Had my first contact with Toretto
today. It went well, I'm sure I can
get to him.

BILKINS
Think it's his people

BRIAN
Sir, they're thugs. They lack the
sophistication.

BILKINS
Why focus there

Brian looks at Mia's picture and softens a notch. He has to
go back. Somehow.

BRIAN
If the Dominator's not popping these
trucks, he knows who is.

Brian gestures sweepingly at the mosaic of mugshots.

BRIAN (CONTINUED)
This world revolves around him.
These peckernecks worship him, he's
never lost a race. Race Wars is

Race Wars. To beat Dominic Toretto,
King of the quarter mile. I'll be
there too, because after the racing's
done and everyone's raving on ecstasy,
our suspects will have a big criminal
buddy hug and brag about how bad they
are. When they will open their
mouths, I will hear them.

TANNER
Race Wars, huh San Bernardino
Sheriffs been trying to get in there

BRIAN
Man has no choice. He's been an
outstanding resource. He informed me
Toretto's racing tonight at the L.A.
Coliseum. I'll be there.

You're not racing. Whack some family
in a minivan and the city's ass is
wide open for a huge payout. Hear me

Loud and clear, Sergeant.

BILKINS
I was leery putting a greenhorn
undercover, but you're soldiering well

TANNER
Hold up, O'Conner. .

Brian pauses.

TANNER (CONTINUED)
You can't do your job with hands tied
behind your back. Sometimes it's
easier to ask for forgiveness than to
ask for permission. Do what you have
to tonight, but remember, that's an
eighty thousand dollar car and we have
to return it without a scratch.

BRIAN
(grins gratefully)
I'll use my best judgement.

TANNER
I know you will.

Tanner looking at Brian, there is a strong connection
between these two.

TANNER (CONTINUED)
I worry about you. Toretto's a
psycho, beating a guy half to death
and all. I couldn't take it if you
took a bullet in the back of the head.

A beat, Brian darkens, intense.

BRIAN :
That will never happen to me. Never.

claps Brian on the shoulder and nods for him to go.

This is what it's all about; cruising. LA's tribes brought
together by their cars. Chicanos, Asians, Whiteboys,
Blacks. Brian is in a slow moving line of awesome cars. Low
riders. Plush Humvees. Pimp Daddy Mercedes and Beemers.
And of course, street racers in a rainbow of intense colors.

Brian passes a parked lowrider, brimming with hot GIRLS as
two HOMIES play videogames on a built-in console. Brian
gets lots of smiles from the chicas. As a dozen different
BASSLINES thump.

Brian pulls into a huge parking lot where racers gather.
His green Supra gets lots of stares and nods.

Brian parks, gets out of the car, sits on the hood.

HECTOR SILVA approaches him. Shaved head, a tattoo on his
neck. Built like a fireplug. He checks out the Supra.

HECTOR

EDWIN

Dominic silences Jesse with a look. Dominic, pokerfaced,
measures Brian with piercing eyes. Then:

DOMINIC
You're in. Let's go.

Brian smiles. Letty witness an exchange of looks between
him and Mia. Letty crosses to Brian's Supra as he gets in.
Something surprisingly innocent and awkward about her.
LETTY
Thing's go bad for you, I can givé you
a ride home.

BRIAN
Home's awful far.

LETTY

She smiles. Brian smiles, gets in his car. Mia, hitching a

Dominic SEES Brian leaning against the Supra. Grinning like
an idiot, high on adrenaline and danger.

Brian spits blood, he bit his tongue. Mia gives Brian an
impressed nod. Dominic looking at Brian, measuring him anew
as he unwinds tape from his hands.

BRIAN

LAUGHS. The other teams, the spectators, watch Brian.
Adlibs of "Punk," and "Fool." Never more the outsider than

Brian gets to the Viet Long Beach Team. He swaps Lance's

BRIAN (CONTINUED)
Sneaky Pete's the shot caller. Lance

Dominic takes the clipping, hangs it up.

accident.

Dominic squats before the car, contemplating it, suddenly
seeming old and weary.

Brian lifts a cover -- A Honda Civic, white not black. The

The drop is deadly. Dangling lube, oil and air hoses are
the only way down.

Brian dangles from the skylight. He begins to swing. Back

with them.

He slides down the hoses to the floor.

Then Dominic joins Brian. And Vinee. Now on terra firma,
the three trade relieved looks.

Brian steers his maglite across the darkness. Illuminating
the impressive equipment. This is the most elaborate garage

fancy pick-up for errands. Even Dominic is, impressed.

Pete presses the nozzle under Ted's nostril. Fills his

Coughing in agony.

Pete clamps Ted's head between his knees and fills his mouth
with oil. Ted struggles violently.

Patton's wife.

Brian REACTS, ready to throw Tanner off the balcony.

The spear embeds itself into the seat by the Driver.

Vince stands atop Dominic's Civic. An insane surfer. He
activates the winch on his chest and leaps- :

ornament, pulls a chemical grenade from his pocket and pulls

the pin and tries to pull himself onto the hood.

Dominic pulls far ahead to recon the freeway.

oscillate back and forth in ever increasing arcs.

Swinging back and forth in time with the swerving Rig. Not
easy with a drive wheel running on the rim.

PETE TRAN 200
Appears alongside Dominic.

Dominic knows it's for keeps this time. He jerks the wheel,
ducks, swerving away. Just as--

Vince jumps.

And Pete opens fire.

BRRRRDDDDDDDT !

Rounds pepper Dominic's car, the hood, the delicate engine.
Vince falls under the rig's massive bumper. Being dragged

a speedy getaway.

Brian gently lays Vince on the street. Kneels over him.
Vince is pretty torn up. The cable has mutilated his right
forearm. He has bad road rashes. The black Civic comes to a
stop near them and Dominic is out like a shot. Brian does a
first aid assessment, all business.

DOMINIC
You know what you're doing

Dominic yanks off his belt. Hands it to Brian. Who
tourniquets Vince's arm just below the armpit.

Brian straddles Vince and does heart thrusts.

After a set of chest thrusts, Brian checks for a pulse. To
his great relief, he finds one.

BRIAN
He's back.

DOMINIC
He's breathing.

Dominic's relief is clear. He looks at Brian.

SCREAMS into the duct tape on his face.

DOMINIC AND BRIAN

Trade incensed looks. Dominic points at:

THE CRANE CONTROL BOX

Mounted to the far wall of the warehouse. A perilously
exposed stretch of open floor leads to it.

Bullets tear into Big Screen TV's and motorcycles as they

It appears to be solidly resting on the floor. On Jesse.

Brian works the controls and the Suburban is suddenly lifted
several feet from the floor.

Dominic crosses to Jesse. His head hangs limp.

Then his eyes open and he begins thrashing. Very much
